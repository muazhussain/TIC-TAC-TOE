Description:

    Tic-Tac-Toe is a pencil-and-paper game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3*3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.

    This program is a game program, Tic-Tac-Toe. Most of us have played this game in our leisure time, and I have made a C++ program on it.
    
	 This program uses a board to control players in each turn players enter a number and choose a move. This program assumes that player one always moves first and uses X's. Player two moves at the second position and uses O's.


Program Structure:

	The program consists of four steps
		# Get input of two players name
		# Display board
		# Get player move
